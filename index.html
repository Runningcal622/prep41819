    <h1>Problems using maps</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>
        One common problem people have when trying to represent data on maps is scaling. When people try to show
        difference in the prevalence of something based on geography; they often use the size of circles.
        Often when you go to show that some region has double of some other region you want to double the size of
        the circles, if done incorectly it quadruples the size. This happens when they double the diameter rather than
        double the value of pi*r^2.
      </li>
      <li>
        One other problem that occurs happens with choropleths. The problem happens because of how to divide the
        data to specific colors. If you use a skewed data set where data never approaches particular values, it wouldn't
        make sense to provide a color. However, if you make those breaks too large, your representation will become
        saturated and appear homogeneous.
